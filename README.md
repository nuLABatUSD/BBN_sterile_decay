The following edits have been made to the alterbbn_v2.2 files and why:


The 'CuteGraphs' file is used for comparing the bbn outputs from alterbbn_v2.2 with varying eta values through graphs. Such graphs discribe:
  1. All of the elements given a particular eta value plotted against eachother over time (temperature)
  2. Each element given 3 different eta values over time (temperature)
  3. Each element given 3 different eta values with the bbn output and their predicted equilibrium values plotted against time (temperature)
  4. Replicating the graphs from [section 5.6 Figure 3] (https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/hkurkisu/Cosm_I.pdf)
